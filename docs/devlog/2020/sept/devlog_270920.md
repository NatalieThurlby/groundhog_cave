I've been very slowly working through Godot's ["Your First Game" tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html) today, but trying to put my own mark on it in order to:
A. really understand what is happening, and:
B. develop some semblance of a workflow for a gamejam (including creating artwork).

This is actually not my first game in Godot, since I've done this same tutorial before, a couple of years ago. Back then, I must have just done a lot of copying, because I remember almost nothing about it.

So today, I:
- Created the `Player` scene. 
> In accordance with the tutorial, the `Player` was originally an `Area2D` node.
- Installed Krita, fixed my Wacom Pen driver, and drew some (bad) artwork:
> Here they are:
> ![](/characters/player/player_walk_1.png)
> ![](/characters/player/player_walk_2.png)
> It's understandable that they're a bit crappy, I haven't drawn anything in a long while now. Maybe a year or two. Using Krita 
> was so much smoother, quicker, easier and less hack-y than I remember Gimp being. I really rate it!
- Instead of the `Mob` enemies from the tutorial, I made a `Collectable` scene; an apple that the player collects to make their score go up.
> This required changing the `Player` to a `KinematicBody2D` node, and connecting emitted signals as the Collectables are
> instantiated to increase the score. I also made the apples rotate as they fall, and gave them some gravity. Getting this to 
> work did make me feel I'd understood *something*.

I found the process of doing this today a little frustrating at times. There seems to be a lot of different node types that you just have to get to know to be able to get going and I don't feel I know my way around the documentation yet. I feel that I am not using the object-orientated-ness well (if I needed to make a lot of similar collectables, I would have to research how), and I'd like to dig into what's possible with animation, too.

I also feel that I'd be much more comfortable using the GUI less. As I type this (in visual code, with the project open), I can see that the scene `.tscn` files could be typed out instead, which would be exciting. Tutorials at the moment seem to be very GUI-focused. I am trying to document what I'm doing (not just my code, but workflows, tools, etc) to help me if I come back to things later.
